# Flight Paths
Share with friends the countries you travelled to ✈️

## Setup
`git clone git@github.com:shushugah/flight-paths.git && yarn`

By default, no countries are selected. You can change that by appending [ISO numeric country](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_numeric) codes, dash separated, e.g http://127.0.0.1:8080/?countries=4-840 will highlight Afghanistan (004) and USA (840).

## Future features

- [ ] animated travel
- [ ] UI to add countries
- [ ] Mark cities you've been to
